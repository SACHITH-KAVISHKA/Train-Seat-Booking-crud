# ✅ **USER_ID CONSTRAINT ISSUE FIXED!**

## 🐛 **Final Issue Identified & Resolved**

### **Root Cause**
The database column `user_id` was set to **NOT NULL** but the application wasn't providing a value for it.

### **Error Details**
```sql
Column 'user_id' cannot be null
constraint [null]
INSERT INTO bookings (..., user_id) VALUES (..., null)
```

### **Solution Applied**

#### 1. **Updated BookingServiceImpl.java**
```java
// Added during booking creation:
booking.setUserId(1L); // Default user ID until authentication is implemented
```

#### 2. **Updated Booking.java Entity**
```java
@Column(name = "user_id", nullable = false, columnDefinition = "BIGINT DEFAULT 1")
private Long userId = 1L;
```

## 🎯 **What This Fix Does**

1. **Sets Default User ID**: All bookings now get `userId = 1` by default
2. **Prevents NULL Constraint Violations**: Database won't reject bookings anymore
3. **Maintains Data Integrity**: Preserves existing database schema
4. **Future-Proof**: Ready for User authentication system implementation

## 🧪 **Test the Fix NOW**

### **Steps to Verify**
1. **Open**: http://localhost:3000
