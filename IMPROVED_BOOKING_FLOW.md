# Improved Booking Flow with E-Ticket Modal

## Overview
Updated the booking system to provide a seamless user experience where the e-ticket modal appears automatically after booking completion, and clicking "OK" navigates the user back to the home page.

## New Booking Flow

### 1. **Booking Process**
- User completes booking form (passenger details, payment)
- Loading animation shows during processing
- Booking is saved to database

### 2. **Automatic E-Ticket Display**
- **No page navigation** after booking completion
- E-ticket modal opens **automatically** immediately after successful booking
- Modal shows complete booking details in professional format

### 3. **E-Ticket Modal Features**
- **Professional Layout**: Blue gradient header with Sri Lanka Railways branding
- **Complete Details**:
  - PNR number and booking status
  - Train information (name, number)
  - Journey details (departure/arrival stations, times, date)
  - Passenger information (name, email, phone)
  - Booking summary (seats, fare, total amount in Sri Lankan Rupees)
  - QR code placeholder for verification

### 4. **User Actions**
- **Download Ticket**: Users can download e-ticket as text file
- **OK Button**: Primary action that closes modal and navigates to home page
- **Modal cannot be closed** by clicking outside or pressing Escape (ensures user sees ticket)

## Technical Implementation

### Key Changes Made:

#### 1. **Booking Pages** (`BookingPage.jsx` & `BookingPageTemp.jsx`)
```javascript
// Automatic modal display after booking success
setBookingSuccess(result);
setActiveStep(3);
setShowTicketModal(true); // Show immediately

// Navigate to home when modal closes
<TicketModal
  open={showTicketModal}
  onClose={() => {
    setShowTicketModal(false);
    navigate('/'); // Go to home page
  }}
  // ... other props
/>
```

#### 2. **E-Ticket Modal** (`TicketModal.jsx`)
```javascript
// Enhanced modal configuration
<Dialog 
  open={open} 
  onClose={onClose} 
  maxWidth="md" 
  fullWidth
  disableEscapeKeyDown // Prevents closing with Escape key
>

// Improved button layout
<DialogActions sx={{ justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  <Button variant="outlined" onClick={handleDownload}>
    Download Ticket
  </Button>
  <Button variant="contained" onClick={onClose}>
    OK
  </Button>
</DialogActions>
```

#### 3. **Confirmation Step Simplified**
- Removed navigation buttons from confirmation step
- Shows only success message and PNR number
- Modal handles all user interaction

## User Experience Flow

1. **User books ticket** → Loading animation appears
2. **Booking succeeds** → Success message + E-ticket modal opens automatically
3. **User views ticket** → Complete booking details displayed professionally
4. **User clicks "Download"** (optional) → Ticket downloaded as text file
5. **User clicks "OK"** → Modal closes + Navigate to home page
