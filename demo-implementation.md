# Station Dropdown Implementation

## Backend Implementation

I've successfully implemented the backend endpoint to fetch unique station names from the database. The implementation includes:

### 1. New Repository Method
```java
@Query("SELECT DISTINCT s.departureStation FROM Schedule s " +
       "UNION " +
       "SELECT DISTINCT s.arrivalStation FROM Schedule s " +
       "ORDER BY 1")
List<String> findAllUniqueStations();
```

### 2. Service Method
```java
@Override
@Transactional(readOnly = true)
public List<String> getAllStations() {
    log.info("Fetching all available station names");
    
    try {
        List<String> stations = scheduleRepository.findAllUniqueStations();
        log.info("Found {} unique stations", stations.size());
        return stations;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        log.error("Error fetching station names: {}", e.getMessage());
        throw new RuntimeException("Failed to fetch station names", e);
    }
}
```

### 3. Controller Endpoint
```java
@GetMapping("/stations")
public ResponseEntity<ApiResponseDTO<List<String>>> getAllStations() {
    
    log.info("Fetching all available station names");
    
    List<String> stations = bookingService.getAllStations();
    
    String message = stations.isEmpty() ? 
            "No stations found" : 
            String.format("Found %d available stations", stations.size());
    
    ApiResponseDTO<List<String>> response = ApiResponseDTO.success(message, stations);
    
    return ResponseEntity.ok(response);
}
```

## Frontend Implementation

Updated the SearchPage component to use Material-UI Autocomplete components that fetch station data from the backend:

### 1. Updated Imports
- Added `Autocomplete` to Material-UI imports

### 2. State Management
- Added `stationsLoading` state
- Integrated with existing `stations` from BookingContext
- Added `getStations` function from context

### 3. Data Fetching
- Added useEffect to fetch stations on component mount
- Only fetches if stations array is empty
- Includes error handling with toast notifications

### 4. UI Components
- Replaced both departure and arrival TextField components with Autocomplete
- Added loading indicators
- Maintained existing icon integration
- Added freeSolo prop for custom input capability

### 5. Station Suggestions
- Replaced hardcoded popular stations with dynamic stations from database
- Shows first 8 stations as quick selections
- Displays count of additional stations available

## Key Features

✅ **Database Integration**: Fetches real station names from Sri Lankan railway schedule data
✅ **Autocomplete Functionality**: Users can type to search or select from dropdown
✅ **Loading States**: Shows loading indicators while fetching data
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user feedback
✅ **Performance**: Only fetches station data once per session
✅ **User Experience**: Quick station selection chips for popular routes
✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
✅ **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation

## API Endpoint

**GET** `/api/bookings/stations`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "message": "Found 12 available stations",
  "data": [
    "Badulla",
    "Beliatta",
    "Colombo Fort",
    "Galle",
    "Jaffna",
    "Kankesanturai",
    "Kandy",
    "Matara",
    "Vavuniya"
  ],
  "timestamp": "2025-10-01T09:30:00.000Z"
}
```

## Station Data

The implementation fetches from actual Sri Lankan railway stations including:
- Colombo Fort (main hub)
- Kandy (hill country)
- Galle (southern coast)
- Jaffna (northern region)
- Badulla (eastern region)
- And other authentic Sri Lankan railway stations

This provides a much better user experience with real data instead of hardcoded values.
